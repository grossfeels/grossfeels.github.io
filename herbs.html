        <h3>Clove</h3>
           
             <ol>
                  
                <li>Possesses Anti-Microbial Capabilities</li>         
                    
                <p class= "p1">Clove has the greatest anti-microbial ability over E. coli and also exerted considerable control over Staph aureus which causes acne and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which causes pneumonia.</p>

                <li>Fights Candida</li>
                  
                 <p class= "p1">One of the most power applications of clove is to fight candida. Clove is as effective as nystatin, a drug commonly prescribed to manage yeast infections of the mouth, at battling Candida.</p>

                 <p class= "p1">Clove is a reliable solution for dry socket and for relieving the pain and discomfort associated with various dental disorders. Clove essential oil has the same numbing effect as benzocaine, a topical agent commonly used before needle insertion, which makes it good for teething babies. Clove oil significantly decreases decalcification, and actually remineralizes teeth.</p>
                  
                <li>High in Anti-Oxidant Value</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">Second only to raw sumac bran, ground clove has the astounding ORAC value of 290,283 units! That value means per gram cloves have a very high anti-oxidant value.</p>

                <p class= "p1">In a nutshell, antioxidants are molecules that reverse the damage that free radicals cause including cell death and cancer. Research has shown that antioxidants slow aging, degeneration and protect the body against bad bacteria and viruses.

        <h3>Ginger</h3>
        
            <ol>
                  
                <li>Helps Prevent Stroke and Heart Disease</li>                 
                    
                <p class= "p1">Garlic, ginger and onions all have an anti-blood-clotting ability—when eaten together they’re a powerful mainstay against heart attacks and stroke!</p>

                <li>Treats Indigestion and Nausea</li>
                  
                 <p class= "p1">Ginger helps the stomach release its contents into the small intestines. This is one reason why ginger helps people who are bloated, constipated and have other gastrointestinal disorders.<br> It relaxes the smooth muscle in your gut lining and helps food move along throughout the system.</p>
                  
                <li>Boosts Immunity and Respiratory Function</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">Because ginger is so effective at warming the body, it helps break down the accumulation of toxins in your organs. It’s also known to cleanse the lymphatic system, our body’s sewage system.</p>
                
                <li>Fights Bacterial Infections</li>
                  
                 <p class= "p1">The Journal of Microbiology and Antimicrobials published a study in 2011 that compared the ability of ginger to kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes with conventional antibiotics. Nigerian researchers discovered that the natural solution won over the drugs — chloramphenicol, ampicillin and tetracycline — every time!</p>

                 <p class= "p1">
               This is important because these two bacteria are extremely common in hospitals and oftentimes cause complications to an already immune-compromised patient.</p>
                  
                <li>Treats Fungal Infections</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">One of the trickier issues to control because they’re increasingly resistant to conventional medicine, fungal infections don’t stand a chance against ginger. Of the 29 plant species evaluated in a Carleton University study, ginger won the prize for having the extract most effective at killing fungus.</p>
                       
                <li>Fights Cancer</li>
                  
                 <p class= "p1">Working with mice without immune systems, University of Minnesota scientists discovered that three weekly feedings of [6]-gingerol delayed the growth of colorectal cancer cells. University of Michigan researchers confirmed these results with ovarian cancer. In fact, they found that “Ginger treatment of cultured ovarian cancer cells induced profound growth inhibition in all cell lines tested.”</p>
                
                <li>Reverses Diabetes</li>
                  
                 <p class= "p1">Gingerols are widely known to naturally improve diabetes and enhance insulin sensitivity. Building off this knowledge, a 2006 study out of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry discovered that they could also suppress sorbitol accumulation in human blood cells and sugar-fed rats. Simply put, ginger not only helps prevent and reverse diabetes itself — it protects against and improves diabetic complications like diabetic retinopathy!</p>

                <p class= "p1">The researchers at the University of Coimbra in Portugal found that the oil was lethal to a whole range of skin-pathogenic strains. Co-researcher, Professor Lígia Salgueiro explained that the essential oils distilled from the Lavandula genus of the lavender plant work by destroying the fungal cell's membrane.</p>

                <li>Heals Wounds</li>

                <li>Relieves Muscle Pain</li>                 
                    
                <p class= "p1">Peppermint essential oil is a very effective natural painkiller and muscle relaxant. It is especially helpful in soothing an aching back, sore muscles, and melting away tension headaches. A study shows that peppermint oil applied topically has pain relief benefits associated with the treatement of Fibromyalgia and Myofascial Pain Syndrome.</p>

                <li>Sinus Care</li>
                  
                 <p class= "p1">Inhaling diffused peppermint oil can oftentimes immediately unclog your sinuses and offer relief to scratchy throats. Peppermint acts as an expectorant and may provide relief for colds, cough, sinusitis, asthma, and bronchitis.</p>

                 <p class= "p1">Ingesting peppermint can stave off the munchies and can help you feel full faster because our apetites are directly linked to our sense of smell, which peppermint impacts.</p>
                  
                <li>Energizes</li>

        <h3>Rosemary</h3>
        
            <ol>
                  
                <li>Boosts Memory</li>                 
                    
                <p class= "p1">Rosemary acts as a cognitive stimulant. It was said to improve memory and help to increase intelligence and focus and its effects on the brain indicate an increase in memory retention.</p>

                <li>Strengthens Immune System</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">The active components in rosemary are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic in nature. This represents <br>a three-pronged attack against many different diseases and pathogens that could threaten the immune system or damage the integrity of the body. Antioxidant compounds form a secondary line of defense behind the body’s own immune system, and rosemary contains a significant amount of those powerful compounds, including rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, betulic acid, and carnosol.</p>
                  
                <li>Relieves Pain</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">As an analgesic substance, rosemary has been topically applied in a paste or salve for hundreds of years to the affected area of the pain. When consumed orally, it acts as a pain reliever for harder to reach spots, such as headaches and pain from a condition. In fact, one of the most popular uses of rosemary is for the treatment of migraines. Applying a decoction to the temples, or simply smelling the aroma of rosemary has been linked to reducing the severity of migraine symptoms.</p>
                
                <li>Fights Bacteria</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">While the general immune boosting qualities of rosemary are impressive enough, it is specifically powerful against bacterial infections, particularly those in the stomach. H. pylori bacteria is a common and very dangerous pathogen that can cause stomach ulcers, but rosemary has been shown to prevent its growth when consumed. Similarly, it is linked to preventing Staph infections, which kill thousands of people each year.</p>
                  
                <li>Improves Mood & Relives Stress</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">The aroma of rosemary alone has been linked to improving mood, clearing the mind, and relieving stress in those with chronic anxiety or stress hormone imbalances. When the plant is consumed or applied topically in some sort of salve of the leaves, it can have similar effects.</p>
                                  
                <li>Soothes Stomach</li>
                  
                <p class= "p1">Rosemary has traditionally been used by dozens of cultures as<br> a natural remedy for upset stomachs, constipation, bloating, diarrhea, and everything in between. Its anti-inflammatory and stimulant effects are largely the cause of these effects, so adding it to your weekly diet can quickly help you regulate your bowel movements and your gastrointestinal system.</p>
